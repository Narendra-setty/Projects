# Projects:
1. Sequential Detector
📝 Description:
A Sequential Detector is a digital circuit that detects a specific sequence of bits in a serial data stream. It is commonly implemented using Finite State Machines (FSMs) and is used in error detection, communication systems, and digital security applications.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
HDL: Verilog / VHDL
Tools: Xilinx Vivado / Quartus Prime / ModelSim
Implementation: FPGA / Simulation-based
⚙️ Functionality:
Detects a predefined binary sequence (e.g., "1011") in an input data stream.
Uses a Mealy or Moore FSM to transition between states based on input bits.
Outputs a high signal when the sequence is detected.
✅ Problem Solved:
Used in error detection and pattern matching in digital systems.
Helps in detecting specific commands in serial communication protocols.



2. Traffic Light Controller
